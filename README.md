# Flight Delay Prediction Project
## Overview
This project is focused on predicting flight delays based on data related to flights in the United States during the year 2015. We will clean and preprocess the dataset, apply various regression models, and evaluate their performance.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project include:

Developing an accurate machine learning model for predicting flight delays using flight-related features.
Gaining practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling within the domain of data science and machine learning.
## Main Features
Data Preprocessing: We perform data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
Regression Models: We implement regression models, including but not limited to:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees Regression
Random Forest Regression
## Technologies Used
This project utilizes several key libraries and technologies:

Python: We use Python as the primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
pandas: pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: numpy is employed for numerical computations.
scikit-learn (sklearn): scikit-learn is used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
optuna: optuna is used for hyperparameter optimization.
cartopy: cartopy is utilized for geospatial data visualization.
matplotlib: matplotlib is used for creating plots and visualizations.
scipy: scipy is used for scientific and statistical computations.
